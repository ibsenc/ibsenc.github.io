## Camille Ibsen's Personal Website

### Description
As a project for CS5610 Web Development, this personal website was made using only HTML and CSS. This website is meant to showcase my experience, projects, hobbies, and provide methods of contact. It can be viewed on both desktop and mobile.

Prior to implementation, I designed and prototyped this website using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/6pQohPmaMtEDZ4WDsaWVE4/Personal-Website?node-id=0%3A1&t=osmKwUzamYyV5G7T-1).

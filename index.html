                <p class="first-paragraph">As a science lover, there are few things you could teach me about the world that would not excite me.</p>
                <p>From the network of fungi under our feet to the way in which light passes through a prism to create a rainbow, science is truly fascinating. This is why my transition from biology and healthcare to computer science felt so natural. There is no shortage of information, which, when consumed, will open ones eyes to how the world works around them, whether physical or virtual.</p>
                <p>After experiencing firsthand the weight of the healthcare industry on my shoulders during a global pandemic, I was deterred from working directly in the field, but not from learning in general. My curiosity and drive to learn more blooms wherever I go. Even small exposures to programming over a long period of time had me eventually leaping at the chance to dive into the field of computer science. So, I did.</p>
                <p>I am currently in my second-to-last semester in Northeastern University’s MSCS Align program, where I am developing foundational skills to become an ambitious and reliable software engineer.</p>
                <p>A simpler mind may be deterred by someone with a diverse background, however, others would notice that it is simply the result of a curiosity and excitement that can steer one in any direction.</p>
